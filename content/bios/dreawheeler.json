If you are or ever have been a competitive athlete, you know the dedication, sacrifice, sweat and tears it takes to succeed. Every time I question my ability to make something happen, I look back at the girl who ran track and remember I was, and still am, that person!",
    "What is something we would never know from looking at you": "I have a fear of death. I come off as super confident and strong, which I am, but deep down, I do fear the end. I think it stems from losing some very important people in my life at a young age. However, this fear doesnâ€™t cripple me; it gives me the perspective to live every day to the fullest.",
    "Who is your hero and why": "My mom! As I get older, I understand how much she gave up in having me and my older sister before the age of 18.

When my Pops died and left her with 5 kids, she kept going and got me into university with a full scholarship. She is the bomb dot com.",
